# Robocode with Neural Net and Reinforcment Learning

Implemented Reinforcement Learning with Backpropagation on a robot tank learning agent to enable the tank to perform progressively better with the number of battles in a robot tank
battle on Robocode. The architecture of learning system used was in the form of separate neural net for each action. Analyzed the performance matrices in form of win-rate and Q-Error.
